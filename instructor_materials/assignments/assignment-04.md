# IDM231 Assignment 4: Date Input functionality
Create a simple page with an area for a user to add their birthday. Based on the input date, we want to tell the user what season their birthday falls in. For example, if the user inputs 7/12/93, we should output the sample below onto the page

```
Birthday: 7/12/93
Season: Summer
```

Assume
- Spring range is from March 22 - June 21
- Summer range is June 22 - September 21
- Fall range is September 22 - December 21
- Winter range is December 22 - March 21

You can create a folder on your server called `idm231` inside your `public_html`. Inside that folder, you can create another folder called `assignment-4`. Your folder structure should look something like this `public_html/idm231/assignment-4`
# Requirements
- JavaScript must be included using an external file
- After clicking a button, the date and the season if falls in must be displayed on the page
